DirScape is written for linux, planned updates for UNIX, with the aim of bringing heuristics to categorical file organization plus advanced duplicate handling.

The goal of DirScape is to primarily solve my own problem of hideous file heirarchies that are the chaotic jumble of what happens when you migrate/upgrade/reinstall and are forced to backup your current documents area and attempt to re-integrate it at a later date.

Installation: in work.

Usage: in work.
